# CSC1024-Project-2024
This is a simple Inventory Management System developed using Python and Streamlit as part of a group project for an academic course. It is designed to help small businesses or academic users manage products, suppliers, sales, and stock levels using a user-friendly web interface.

The system uses basic .txt files to store data instead of a database, making it lightweight and easy to understand for learning purposes. It supports features like adding and updating products, recording sales, placing supplier orders, and generating useful inventory reports.

This project was collaboratively developed to demonstrate practical understanding of programming concepts, file handling, data validation, and user interface design in Python.
